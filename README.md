# Turtle Catching Game (Python)

This is a simple turtle-based game developed while following the **"Learn Python and Software Development Concepts in 100 Days"** course by **Atƒ±l Samancƒ±oƒülu** on Udemy.

The game is about catching a turtle that randomly moves on the screen. It was built as part of the early lessons in the course to understand basic Python syntax, functions, event handling, and the `turtle` module.
